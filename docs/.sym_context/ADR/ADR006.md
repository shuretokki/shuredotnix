# ADR-006: Single-User Architecture

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-01-05

## Context
Should this configuration support multiple desktop users per machine?

## Decision
Adopt a **single primary user** design pattern where `vars.username` defines the one user configured with full desktop environment and secrets.

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Simpler codebase with fewer edge cases
- Easier fork workflow: change `vars.nix` and rename user directory
- Matches 90%+ of personal NixOS usage patterns
- Industry standard for personal dotfiles repositories

**Negative:**
- Cannot configure desktop for multiple users per machine
- Shared family computers require workarounds

## Alternatives Considered
- **Multi-user support:** Rejected due to complexity vs value trade-off
- **Dynamic primary user option:** Deferred until real need arises (YAGNI)
