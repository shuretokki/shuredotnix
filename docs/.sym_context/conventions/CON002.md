# CON-002: Commit Message Style

**Applies To:** All git commits in this repository.

## The Rule

Commits should be **atomic** - one logical change per commit. A single commit may touch multiple files if they are part of the same logical change.

## Format

```
<action> <subject>
```

**Constraints:**
1.  **Maximum 5 words**.
2.  **All lowercase** (no capital letters).
3.  **No punctuation** (no periods, colons, or emojis).
4.  **Present tense** (e.g., "add" not "added").

## What is "Atomic"?

An atomic commit is a **self-contained unit of work**. It should:
- Do one thing (add a feature, fix a bug, update config)
- Be revertable without breaking other changes
- Make sense on its own in `git log`

## Examples

### Good Examples
```
add bluetooth module          # Single module, may touch multiple files
fix wifi reconnection bug     # Bug fix across related files
update hyprland keybindings   # Config change
refactor audio settings       # Refactor within a feature area
```

### Bad Examples
```
wip                           # Not descriptive
fix stuff                     # Too vague
Add Bluetooth Module.         # Capital letters, punctuation
update bluetooth and wifi     # Two unrelated changes
```

## Exception

For `docs/.sym_context/` changes, batching is encouraged:
```
update context docs
```

## Rationale

1.  **Logical Units**: Each commit represents a complete thought.
2.  **Easy Reverts**: If a change breaks something, `git revert` undoes only that change.
3.  **Clear History**: `git log` tells a story of features and fixes, not individual file edits.
