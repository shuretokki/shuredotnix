# COR-002: Action Versioning & Assumptions

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-05

This document corrects the AI behavior of assuming action versions based on outdated training data or superficial search.

## Incident Analysis (2026-01-05)

**What Happened:**
1. AI assumed `actions/checkout@v5` based on search results for "latest version" (which returned v4.2.2, but AI Hallucinated v5 in plan).
2. User provided a local file showing `actions/checkout@v6` usage.
3. AI initially missed the specific SHA in the file until prompted.

**Root Causes:**
1. **Hallucination:** Proposing `v5` when search found `v4`.
2. **Context Blindness:** Not reading the user-provided file thoroughly for version details.
3. **assumption:** Assuming standard versioning (v4 -> v5) without verification.

## Corrective Protocol: The "Version Verification" Rule

**When using any external tool/action:**

1. **NEVER guess a version number.**
2. **Step 1: Search Explicitly**
   - Query: `latest release [tool name] github`
   - Query: `[tool name] releases`
3. **Step 2: Check User Context**
   - Does the user already use this tool in another file?
   - Did the user provide a snippet? **Use that version.**
4. **Step 3: Verification**
   - Run `git ls-remote https://github.com/[owner]/[repo] refs/tags/[version]`
   - If it fails, **STOP and ASK**.

## Specific Version Corrections

| Tool | AI Assumption (Wrong) | Actual (2026) |
|------|------------------------|---------------|
| `actions/checkout` | v4 / v5 | **v6** |
| `cachix/install-nix-action` | v27 | **v31** |
| `cachix/cachix-action` | v14 | **v15** |

**Rule:** If a version number seems "too high" or "too low" compared to training data, **trust the evidence** (user files, git ls-remote), not the training data.
