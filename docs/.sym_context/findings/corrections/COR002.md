# COR-002: Assume Outdated by Default

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-05

## Core Principle

**AI training data is frozen in time. The world is not.**

This protocol applies to **ANY** external standard, including but not limited to:
- **Technical Standards**: Tool versions, API signatures, config formats, syntax, libraries.
- **Human Standards**: Policies, codes of conduct, legal terms, cultural norms.
- **Best Practices**: Security patterns, architecture conventions, community guidelines.

**Rule:** If it originates outside this repository, assume it has changed since 2024.

## The "Assume Outdated" Mindset

Before writing ANY code involving external tools, libraries, or patterns:

1. **Assume my syntax is outdated** until verified.
2. **Assume my version numbers are wrong** until verified.
3. **Assume conventions have changed** until verified.

## Verification Hierarchy

**Priority 1: User-Provided Context**
- If user provides a file/snippet, use THAT syntax exactly.
- If user's code builds, it's correct (even if unfamiliar).

**Priority 2: Live Verification**
- `git ls-remote` for GitHub releases.
- `search_web` for current documentation.
- Read raw README from GitHub.

**Priority 3: Ask the User**
- "I'm unsure about the current syntax for X. Can you provide docs?"

**Priority 4 (Last Resort): Training Data**
- Only use training data if all above fail AND user approves.

## Trigger Phrases

When I think or write any of these, I MUST pause and verify:
- "The latest version is..."
- "The correct syntax is..."
- "This should work..."
- "According to my knowledge..."

## Specific Corrections Log

| Domain | AI Assumption | Actual (2026) |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| `actions/checkout` | v4/v5 | **v6** |
| `cachix/install-nix-action` | v27 | **v31** |
| `programs.git.userName` | valid | **use `settings.user.name`** |
| `hyprland.extraConfig` | valid | **use `settings`** |

## Recovery Protocol

If I realize mid-task that I used outdated info:
1. Stop immediately.
2. Inform user: "I may have used outdated syntax."
3. Verify using the hierarchy above.
4. Update this file with the correction.
