# COR-003: Incident - Contributor Covenant Assumption

**Date:** 2026-01-05
**Severity:** Medium (Non-breaking but misleading)

## Incident Description
The agent proposed using **Contributor Covenant v2.1** as the "Industry Standard" without verifying if a newer version existed. The user pointed out that **v3.0** (released July 2025) should be used.

## Root Cause
The agent relied on frozen training data (cutoff before July 2025) and failed to trigger the **COR-002 "Assume Outdated"** protocol because the domain was "Community Standards" rather than "Code versions" or "Syntax".

## Correction
**Community standards and policy documents evolve just like code.**
- **Assumption:** "v2.1 is standard."
- **Reality:** v3.0 exists and invalidates previous assumptions.

## Preventive Measures
Add "Community Standards & Policy Documents" to the domain list in `COR002.md`. When creating any documentation from a template, **verify the latest version** via web search first.
