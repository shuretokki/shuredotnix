# Findings

This folder tracks **active research** and **AI training corrections**.

## Purpose
- Document work-in-progress investigations
- Track complex problems being solved
- **Correct AI outdated patterns** (training data vs reality)

## Subfolders

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `000_In_Progress/` | Active investigations |
| `corrections/` | AI training data corrections |

## Workflow

### For Investigations
1. Create file in `000_In_Progress/` when researching
2. Once resolved:
   - Technical decision → Move to `ADR/`
   - Domain knowledge → Move to `domain_knowledge/`
   - Trivial → Delete

### For AI Corrections
1. When AI suggests outdated code that fails
2. Create/update `corrections/CORXXX.md`
3. AI reads this in future sessions to avoid repeating mistakes
