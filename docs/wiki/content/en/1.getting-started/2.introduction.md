  description: A comprehensive, modular, and declarative NixOS configuration.

Welcome to **shuredotnix** (SDN), a fully integrated NixOS configuration built with **Hyprland** and **Stylix**.

## What is SDN?

**SDN** is a personal [NixOS](https://nixos.org) configuration flake. While the focus is on a highly polished desktop experience, it is architected to be forked, customized, and extended using the declarative power of [Home Manager](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/).

We use a **modular structure** across the entire codebase, featuring:

::card-group
  :::card
  ---
  icon: i-lucide-monitor
  title: Desktop
  to: /modules/display
  ---
  A beautifully themed Hyprland environment with instant switching.
  :::

  :::card
  ---
  icon: i-lucide-settings-2
  title: Core
  to: /modules/core
  ---
  Robust system definitions for audio, boot, and security.
  :::

  :::card
  ---
  icon: i-lucide-app-window
  title: Apps
  to: /modules/apps
  ---
  Declarative configuration for browser, discord, and editors.
  :::

  :::card

  icon: i-lucide-user
  title: Identity
  to: /configuration/identity
  ---
  Single-file identity management for easy personalization.

## Key Features

This configuration includes a range of features designed to improve the Linux desktop experience:

### Core
- **Powered by [Flakes](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Flakes)**: Reproducible, hermetic builds.
- **[Home Manager](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/)**: Declarative dotfiles and user packages.
- **Secrets via [sops-nix](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix)**: Encrypted, secure secret management.

### Visuals
- **[Stylix](https://github.com/danth/stylix) Integration**: One base16 scheme for GTK, QT, and Terminals.
- **Hyprland**: Smooth animations, blur, and window swallowing.
- **Consistent Typography**: Patch-free Nerd Fonts everywhere.

### Developer Experience
- **Modular Architecture**: Isolated components in `library/` for easy toggling.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automatic flake checks and cache warming.
- **Pre-configured Shells**: Ready-to-use dev environments.

**Forkable by Design**: SDN is built to be a template. Clone it, change `identity.nix`, and make it yours.
