# Core Layer

The `library/core` directory contains the foundational system configuration. These modules run as root and define the hardware/OS baseline.

## Key Modules

### Audio (`audio.nix`)
Configures **PipeWire** for low-latency audio.
- Enabled globally (ALSA, PulseAudio, JACK support).
- Includes `wireplumber` for session management.

### Network (`network.nix`)
- **NetworkManager**: Manages connections.
- **Firewall**: `nftables` based, blocks incoming by default.
- **SSH**: Hardened configuration (no root login, key only).

### Security (`security/`)
- **Sops-Nix**: Encrypted secrets management.
- **Hardening**: Kernel parameters and userspace hardening via `security.nix`.
- **DNS**: [Encrypted DNS](/features/core/encrypted-dns) via dnscrypt-proxy.

### GPU (`gpu/`)
Hardware acceleration drivers.
- **NVIDIA**: Proprietary drivers with Wayland support.
- **AMD**: Open source Mesa drivers.

## Usage

Core modules are imported by **Profiles** (e.g., `library/profiles/desktop`). You rarely need to edit them unless changing system-wide policy.
