# Hyprland configuration

Hyper-polished tiling window manager configuration located in `library/display/hyprland/`.

## Structure

The config is split into logical files:
- `base.nix`: General settings (input, layout, cursor).
- `appearance.nix`: Animations, blur, borders (linked to Stylix).
- `keybinds.nix`: Core shortcuts (Super+Q, Super+Space).
- `rules.nix`: Window rules (floating dialogs, opacity).
- `autostart.nix`: Startup apps (bar, wallpaper, notification daemon).

## Key Features

- **Instant Switching**: Workspaces switch instantly with no animation delay.
- **Smart Gaps**: Gaps automatically collapse when only one window is open (if enabled).
- **Swallowing**: Terminals are "swallowed" when launching GUI apps.

## Customization

To change keybinds, edit `library/display/hyprland/keybinds.nix`.
To change window rules, edit `library/display/hyprland/rules.nix`.
