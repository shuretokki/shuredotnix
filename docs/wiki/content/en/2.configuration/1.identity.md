# Identity

The `identity.nix` file is the detailed "single source of truth" for your personal configuration.

It allows you to customize the entire system without digging into complex Nix code.

## Configuration

Located at the root of the repository:

```nix [identity.nix]
{
  username = "shure";
  name = "Shure Tokki";
  email = "shure@example.com";

  # Locale & Time
  locale = "en_US.UTF-8";
  timezone = "Asia/Jakarta";

  # Visuals
  theme = "sh";   # See library/display/themes/
  font = "Inter";
}
```

## How It Works

This file is imported by `flake.nix` and propagated to all modules via `specialArgs`.

- **User Account**: Creates the user with `username` and `name`.
- **Git Config**: Sets global git identity using `name` and `email`.
- **System Locale**: Configures `i18n.defaultLocale` and `time.timeZone`.
- **Stylix**: Sets the global color scheme based on `theme`.

## Changing Your Identity

1. Edit `identity.nix` with your details.
2. Rebuild the system:
   ```bash
   nh os switch
   ```

::callout{icon="i-lucide-lightbulb" color="amber"}
**Tip**: Choosing a theme in `identity.nix` automatically updates your wallpaper, terminal colors, GTK theme, and more.
