# Findings - In Progress

This folder is a **scratchpad** for active research and investigations.

## Purpose
- Document work-in-progress investigations
- Track complex problems being solved
- Capture context before it's forgotten

## Workflow
1. Create a file here when investigating something complex
2. Once resolved:
   - If it's a **technical decision** → Move to `ADR/`
   - If it's **domain knowledge** → Move to `domain_knowledge/`
   - If it's **trivial** → Delete
